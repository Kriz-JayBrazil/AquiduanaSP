**Data Source and method of data structure**
The city of Aquidauana, covering an area of 17,087.021 km² with about 48,184 residents and a demographic density of 2.69 inhabitants per km², boasts a Municipal Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.688. It's a unique transition region hosting two distinct biomes: the Cerrado (Savanna) and the Pantanal. This diverse environment contributes to a rich avifauna, with many bird species drawn to the city's fruit trees and insects attracted by city lights.

From June 2021 to May 2022, 90 field trips were conducted in the mornings and afternoons to observe these birds. These visits were scheduled alternately each week and were focused on predefined points near water bodies or conserved areas. The observation points included areas like Fazenda Buritizal, Ponte Boiadeira, and locations near the center of Aquidauana and urban areas, each offering unique environmental characteristics and serving as habitats for various bird species.
